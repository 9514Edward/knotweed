# winterknotweed
** Introduction **
  - So, umm this dataset was trained on roboflow and then downloaded.  I am leveraging my existing AWS account to train on an AWS GPU
  - Later I will add my Raspbery PI 5 robot code.  Right now, this is just to train the model
  - In August I will photograph living knotweed and retrain. August/September is the optimal time to terminate knotweed.
  - I have until then to develop the robot.
**Training steps
  - Purchase an AWS EC3 P3 Instance
  -
