# winterknotweed
## Introduction 
  - So, umm this dataset was annotated on roboflow, leveraging their Label Assist tool to rapidly draw bounding boxes, then I reviewed all images manually and made corrections/deletions/additions as needed to all the annotations.  Then I downloaded the dataset as shown in the datasets folder here.
  - Today, I am leveraging my existing AWS account to train on an AWS GPU
  - Later I will add my Raspbery PI 5 robot code.  Right now, this is just to train the model
  - In August I will photograph living knotweed and retrain. August/September is the optimal time to terminate knotweed.
  - I have until then to develop the robot.
## Training steps
  - Purchase an AWS EC2 P3 Instance
